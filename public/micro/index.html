    <p>Pyramid scheme where the business model is &ldquo;teaching how to setup pyramid schemes&rdquo;. The instructors take a cut from the pyramid schemes their clients set up.</p>
<p>If someone asks <em>&ldquo;wait, isn&rsquo;t this a pyramid scheme?&rdquo;</em> the reply is always <em>&ldquo;of course it is! But it is YOUR pyramid scheme.&rdquo;</em>. Everyone believes they are near the top because they are all being so open about the fact that they are making pyramid schemes.</p>
