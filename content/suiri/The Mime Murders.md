*baka-mys*

A mime's performances are so convincing that he can kill people by making them believe that the mime's invisible weapon is real and cause them to suffer a heart attack, even when they know that he is just a mime.

The mime also happens to be mute, so when the police starts to suspect that he is behind a series of murders, he flees to a silent retreat monastery.   
The police follows him, but without his mime attire they are unable to to figure out which of the guests is the mime.  

And the morning after the police arrives, a new corpse is discovered.  
The corpse is found face-down in his room with a minor injuries on his body, but the actual cause of death is a heart attack, despite the victim's young age.  
An overturned chair is the only other sign of a struggle in the room.

<summary>Solution (if you can call it that)</summary>
If the victim had struggled with the killer, then it's likely that the victim would have screamed or called for help.  
Since no one heard anything, it's likely that the victim was mute.  
Realistically only a fraction of the guests will be mute, so that's a reason to start considering that the victim was the mime.  

The mime, seeing that the police had arrived at the monastery, decided to commit suicide. Acquiring a weapon or rope would be difficult and take too much time, so the mime stood on the chair, mimed a rope, and kicked the chair.  
The minor injuries were caused by the fall, but he died by making himself believe he was dying from hanging.
