Feature I wish text editors had: Wrap the last line to the first line of the file.  
So if you are near the end you can see the beginning of the file, as if the file was the curved surface of a cylinder that you rotate as you scroll up or down the page.  
I want this because I like to have my cursor line centered at all times ('typewriter mode') but this wastes screen real estate when I'm near the beginning/end of the file. Might as well put more of the file there!
