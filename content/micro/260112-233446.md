*There once was a user named Wotton*  
*whose patience for drivel neared bottom.*  
*Bluesky held some hope,*  
*turned out to be cope.*  
*Any social media is bound to be rotten.*  

*There once was a pal who wished to microblog*  
*yet could find no place for witty dialog.*  
*Twitter? Worse as X.*  
*Fediverse? Looks complex.*  
*Might as well throw paper slips into a bog.*
